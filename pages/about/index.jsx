                Hello! My name is Ryan, a passionate Junior Full Stack Developer
                based in London, Ontario, Canada.
              </p>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">My Story</h2>
              <h3 className="text-l font-bold">How I got here</h3>
              <p className="text-l">
                I have always had a passion for technology and computers. From a
                young age, I was fascinated with machines and how they worked. I
                was in the 9th grade when my father got a computer. I was amazed
                at how it worked and how it could do so many things. I was
                especially fascinated by the internet. I imagined a time when
                all machines would talk to one another and share information. I
                was hooked. I knew I wanted to be a part of this new world.
              </p>
              <p className="text-l">
                My first brush with programming was in the 10th grade. I took a
                computer programming class. I landed probably the worst intro to
                programming teacher you could imagine. We were learning COBOL,
                which seemed like a dead language even then. I was so bored I
                dropped the class. I didn't think I would ever be a programmer.
                I felt like coding was just not for me.
              </p>
              <p className="text-l">
                My next brush with programming was just out of high school. I
                was working a tech support job supporting Dell PC Hardware at
                the time. A girlfriend gifted me a book. It was a book on
                programming in C++. I struggled through the first chapter. It
                was then I was sure programming was not for me. I read the first
                chapter and it seemed like every single concept was over my
                head. I was so discouraged I gave up. I didn't think I would
                ever be a programmer. I felt like coding was just not for me.
              </p>
              <p className="text-l">
                My next brush with was in my mid 40's. The pandemic was raging
                and my brain was not happy. I still could not shake this desire
                to learn how to code
              </p>
              I decided i would give it the final do, not try. It never ends.
              which is one of the things i like the most about it. there is
              always another door to open. A deeper level of understanding that
              can be reached. Here I am. Courses and videos later. I am a junior
              full stack developer. I am still learning which may be painfully
              obvious. I am here though üëãüèæ.
              <p className="text-l">
                I chose the MERN stack because I wanted to learn the most
                popular stack. I also wanted to learn a stack that would allow
                me to build a full application. I am glad I chose it. Next JS is
                a very nice Dev tool üòÅ
